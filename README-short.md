# HRKSPLAT!

SPLAT! was a terrestrial RF Path and Terrain Analysis Tool for Unix/Linux. The
last release was in May 2014 by KD2BD. This tool is quite useful for RF planning
and has some future as a webtool, because of that I decided to maintain a fork.

Some functionality has been added, some removed. The project can be built
using `cmake` now.
